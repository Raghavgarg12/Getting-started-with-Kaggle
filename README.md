# Getting-started-with-Kaggle
Kaggle is a popular online platform for data science competitions, where individuals and teams compete to solve real-world data problems. This beginner's guide will walk you through the essential steps to get started on Kaggle and participate in data science competitions. **Some of the listed competitions have over $1,000,000 prize pools and thousands of competitors.**

## 1. Creating Your Kaggle Account:
To begin your Kaggle journey, visit the Kaggle website (https://www.kaggle.com/) and create a free account. Fill in the required information and complete the registration process.

## 2. Exploring Kaggle Competitions:
Once logged in, navigate to the "Competitions" section to explore the available data science competitions (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions). Browse through the competitions to find one that aligns with your interests and skill level. Start with beginner-friendly competitions to gain hands-on experience.

## 3. Understanding the Competition:
Before diving into a competition, take the time to understand the problem statement, evaluation metrics, and data provided. Read the competition overview, rules, and any associated forum discussions or kernels (code examples shared by participants).

## 3.1 Browse the competition tabs   

There are several tabs below the header, including: Overview, Data, Code, Discussion, Leaderboard, and Rules (along with Team, once you accept the competition rules).

## Overview
When you first navigate to any competition page, you will be on the Overview tab.  This tab is good to read first, and it can include important information like:
- A high-level description of the data and how you’ll use it in the competition,
- How submissions will be evaluated and ranked, 
- Important dates,
- Prizes the top winners will receive.

## Data
The Data tab is where you can download the competition data. You’ll also learn about the data in more detail than was covered in the Overview tab.

You have to accept the rules and join the competition to view the hidden details about the competition.

## Code
All of the notebooks that appear here have been shared with the entire community, in the hope that many people can learn from them.

When viewing a notebook, you can use the “Copy and Edit” button to create your own, private notebook.

Whenever you find a notebook useful, you should thank the author by giving the notebook an upvote.

You can also use the tab to write your own notebooks to work with the data, through the “New Notebook” button.

## Discussion
Use this tab to discuss the competition with other Kagglers.  There are three options for discussing the competition. You can:

## Leaderboard
You’ll use the Leaderboard to see where your submissions rank against other Kagglers.  

When you submit competition predictions, the website checks how close your predictions are to the test set’s true values, according to the competition’s metric.

On the Leaderboard page, there are two tabs: Public Leaderboard and Private Leaderboard.  The Private Leaderboard is the “real” leaderboard that is used to decide the final rankings, and it decides who receives competition prizes.

You might be wondering: Why does Kaggle have two leaderboards?  This is to dissuade [overfitting](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/underfitting-and-overfitting) to the Public Leaderboard.   Unlike the Public Leaderboard, the Private Leaderboard is truly unseen, and it provides a good indication of whether or not your model will generalize well to unseen data.

## Rules
You must accept the rules in order to participate.  The rules govern how many submissions you can make per day, the maximum team size, and other competition-specific details.

## 3.2 Join the competition

Now, you will join the competition by accepting the rules.  To do this, navigate to the Rules tab.

# 4. Make your first submission
Once you have joined the competition, you’re ready to make your very first submission! 
The way you submit to the competition will vary with the type of competition. The other types of competitions are **Code** competitions (which you can read about [here](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/competitions#notebooks-only-competitions)).

## 5. Join a team (Optional)
Once you have accepted the competition rules, you’ll see a Team tab. Here you can join a team or create your own team.

You’re strongly encouraged to chat with other Kagglers in the forums and peruse users’ code.

## 6. Prepare for the end of the competition

Before the competition closes, you will select up to 2 submissions to count towards your final score on the Private Leaderboard.  All other submissions will be ignored when deciding your ranking.

Begin by clicking on “My Submissions” in the competition banner, which will show you all of your submissions.  To select a submission, click on the checkboxes under the “Use For Final Score” column.

## 7. Keep learning!

Kaggle Competitions are a great way to learn new techniques in data science.  

You can learn about new algorithms and approaches from other Kagglers by reading the posts in the Discussion tab.  If you have any questions about the competition, feel free to post your own topic! Releasing public code is a great way to contribute new knowledge to the community, to get feedback on your work from other Kagglers, and also to work towards the path to [Notebooks Grandmaster](https://www.kaggle.com/progression).
## Happy Kaggling. Thank You !
